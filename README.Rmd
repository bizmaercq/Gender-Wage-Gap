## Goals

Here we ask and answer the following question:
What is the difference in predicted wages between men and women with the same job-relevant characteristics?


## Content of Repo

1. data/codebook.rtf contains the description of worker job-relevant worker characteristics.
2. data/pay.descrimination.Rdata: the CPS (2012) data on wages and job-relevant worker characteristics, suc as experience exp, gender, education, etc.
3. gender_wage_gap.R predicts the difference in predicted wages between men and women with the same job-relevant characteristics using linear model with linear specificaions.

## Specifications

We estimate the linear regression model:

        Y = β1D + βr W + ε
        
  D is the indicator of being a female (1 if female and 0 otherwise). W’s are controls.
  Basic model: W’s consist of education and regional indicators, experience, experience squared, and experience cubed.
  Flexible model: W’s consist of controls in the basic model plus all of their two-way interactions.

The estimated gender gap in hourly wage is about $−2.0 with a confidence interval that ranges from about $−2.7 to $−1.
This means that women get paid $2 less per hour on average than men, controlling for experience, education, and geographicalregion.

## Conclusion

To sum it up...
The gender wage gap may partly reflect genuine discrimination against women in the labormarket....
It may also partly reflect the so-called selection effect, namely that
women are more likely to end up in occupations that pay somewhat less (for example, school teachers).
